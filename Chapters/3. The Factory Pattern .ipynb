    "\n",
    "1. Loose coupling between the object creation and the class implementation.\n",
    "2. The client need NOT be aware of the class that creates the object \n",
    "3. Simplify implementations for the client. It is only necessary to know the interface, methods, and parameters that need to be passed to create objects of the desired type. \n",
    "4. Adding another class to the factory to create objects of another type can be easily done without the client changing the code\n",
    "5. The factory can also reuse the existing objects\n",

    "* The **Machine** becomes the ___interface___. \n",
    "* The **CEO** is the ___client___. \n",
    "* The **Toys** are the ___objects___.\n",

    "___There are three variants of the Factory pattern:___\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simple Factory pattern**: This allows interfaces to create objects without exposing the object creation logic.\n",
    "* **Factory method pattern**: This allows interfaces to create objects, but defers the decision to the subclasses to determine the class for object creation.\n",
    "* **Abstract Factory pattern**: An Abstract Factory is an interface to create related objects without specifying/exposing their classes. The pattern provides objects of another factory, which internally creates other objects"
