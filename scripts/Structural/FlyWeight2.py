*What is this pattern about?
This pattern aims to minimise the number of objects that are needed by
a program at run-time. A Flyweight is an object shared by multiple
contexts, and is indistinguishable from an object that is not shared.
The state of a Flyweight should not be affected by it's context, this
is known as its intrinsic state. The decoupling of the objects state
from the object's context, allows the Flyweight to be shared.
